Here, I'm going to create a prototype of Tetris Effect in Jack! Tetris, especially "effect" is one of my favourite games. "Effect" is a crucial part because I want a delay between when the block hits the bottom and when it fixes in place. In addition, it is part of nand2tetris.
Note: Blocks wil be the same every time as there is no local storage. <br>
